Toolbelt Psychology: What the tools we use tell us about the systems we manage

Abstract
--------

What can the tools we use teach us about the systems we manage and even about
ourselves? We'll take a brief tour through the past several decades of systems
management to see how we arrvied at the DevOps movement and we'll examine the
current state of systems automation to see if remembering where we've been can
help us to re-imagine where we might be going.
